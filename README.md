# Clickety-Clack aka EW-Clicker-Enabler
A simple, open source, Easy-Worship Remote App that works on laptops (mac/windows/linux).
This allows for the use of a clicker without losing control on you EW main computer.

## How it works
Why make it simple if it can be complicated?

Here is why:
- If you use a clicker against the main Easy-Worship machine, you will take full control over it i.e. nothing else but Easy Software can be used on that machine until the usage of the clicker is complete
- The solution seams to be to use the EW Remote App on your phone. That will unlock the main Easy-Worship, BUT the app is on the phone, hence very sensitive and needs attention. A singer would not want to look at the app each time there is a slide to move.
- The best of both words would be to 
  - NOT lock the main Easy-Worship computer
  - Get the super perks of using a clicker
- THE ANSWER is ðŸ’¡ - guess what? - Clickety-Clack. Here is how it works
