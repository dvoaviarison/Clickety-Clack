# Clickety-Clack aka EW-Desktop-Remote
A simple, open source and cross-platform EasyWorship Remote App that works on laptops (mac/windows/linux).
This allows for the use of a clicker without losing control on you EW main computer.

## How it works
Why Choose Complexity Over Simplicity?

- **Dilemma**: You want control over the main EasyWorship machine.
   - **Clicker Solution**: Using a clicker is an easy way to control the slides, but it locks the machine to Easy-Worship only.
   - **Phone App Solution**: The EW Remote App unlocks Easy-Worship, but it‚Äôs sensitive and distracting.
- **Ideal Solution**: 
   - **Clickety-Clack**: Slide control without locking down the main computer. Best of both worlds! üçåüí°.
   - Here is how it works
